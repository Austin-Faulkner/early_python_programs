Running tests for sequence class with a dynamic array

START OF TEST 1:
Testing insert, attach, and the constant member functions (4 points).
Starting with an empty sequence.
Testing that size() returns 0 ... Passed.
Testing that is_item() returns false ... Passed.
I'll call start() and look at the items one more time...
All tests passed for this sequence.

I am now using attach to put 10 into an empty sequence.
Testing that size() returns 1 ... Passed.
Testing that is_item() returns true ... Passed.
The cursor should be at item [0] of the sequence
(counting the first item as [0]). I will advance the cursor
to the end of the sequence, checking that each item is correct...Passed.
I'll call start() and look at the items one more time...
The cursor should be at item [0] of the sequence
(counting the first item as [0]). I will advance the cursor
to the end of the sequence, checking that each item is correct...Passed.
All tests passed for this sequence.

I am now using insert to put 10 into an empty sequence.
Testing that size() returns 1 ... Passed.
Testing that is_item() returns true ... Failed.
Basic test of size() or is_item() failed.

Test 1 failed.
END OF TEST 1.


START OF TEST 2:
Testing situations where the cursor goes off the sequence (4 points).
Using attach to put 20 and 30 in the sequence, and then calling
advance, so that is_item should return false ... passed.
Inserting 10, which should go at the sequence's front.
Then calling advance three times to run cursor off the sequence ... passed.
Calling attach to put the numbers 40, 50, 60 ...300 at the sequence's end.
Now I will test that the sequence has 10, 20, 30, ...300.
All tests of this second function have been passed.
Test 2 got 4 points out of a possible 4.
END OF TEST 2.


START OF TEST 3:

Testing that is_item() returns true ... Passed.
The cursor should be at item [1] of the sequence
(counting the first item as [0]). I will advance the cursor
to the end of the sequence, checking that each item is correct...Passed.
